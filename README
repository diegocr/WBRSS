WBRSS is a little tool which will allow you to read RSS news from your
Workbench (or public screen) on a nice way by using a hand-made tiny
window with scrolling text. It comes by default with three pre-defined 
layouts, futhermore it allows you to change colors, text font, etc...

Its configuration is based on tooltypes, which are the follow:


 ToolType    | Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  LEFT       | The program creates a unmovible backdrop window, here you
             | should define at which left position the window must be
             | created.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  TOP        | top position for the window's creation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  WIDTH      | Width for the window (height is deduced from font size)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  FONTNAME   | Font you wish to use to draw news's texts, supported fonts
             | are those which filename ends whith .font or .ttf, to use
             | TrueType Fonts ttengine.library is required
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  FONTSIZE   | Size to use for the provided font name, which size is used
             | as well to the window's height
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  TEXTPEN    | pen color to use with the font
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  BGCOLOR    | Window background color.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  BOXCOLOR   | Window border color (if layout > 0, see below)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DELAY      | text scrolling speed, really useless... keep as-is
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  LAYOUT     | The program has some pre-defined window layouts, setting 
             | this to 0 creates no layout, that is a plain window which
             | could be helpfull if you want to place the window at the 
             | workbench titlebar, setting this to 1 creates a nice layout
             | with a [rss] button, and places the website's favicon which
             | you can click to go to the rss news site (optional), setting
             | this to 2 creates a similar layout to #2 but orange bg.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  TASKPRI    | program's task priority
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SEPIMG     | Image to use as news separator, loaded via datatypes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  FAVICON    | Boolen indicating if you want to receive and use as a button
             | the rss news website's favicon
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PUBSCREEN  | Which screen the program must use, WB if none
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  URL        | Full url pointing to RSS feeds, you can use a unlimited 
             | number of URL tooltypes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Supported controls:

Clicking ESC closed the program.

Clicking SPACE stops the text from scrolling.

Clicking the logo (on the right side of the window) will open the current 
RSS's website, If FAVICON=1 tooltype is used (and openurl.library installed)

Clicking over the scrolling text will open the RSS's website pointing to the
news item you was reading (to expand the info), if openurl.library installed.

Using the left arrow causes the text to scroll faster.
